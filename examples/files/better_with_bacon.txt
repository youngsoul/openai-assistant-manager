The band called, "Better with Bacon" is a northwest Illinois Jam band featuring
 the music of Phish, Widespread Panic, The Grateful Dead, Government Mule, Allman Brothers, The Band, Led Zepplin and more.

The band is also known as, "BwB" - short for better with bacon.

The band members consist of:

Duane on guitar and lead vocals
Mike  on base guitar
Dan  on keyboard and all crazy sounds
Pat on drums and percussion

The band has been together for over 10 years.  After the original bass player, Andy,
moved to California - Mike Ryan joined the band and we have had the same line up
all of these years.

Most of the band members also play in other bands, which helps to round out
the bands original sounding musical style.  Even though they are playing jam band
cover songs, the band adds their own musical influences and style to make each
show a unique experience.

The band got its start a McGonigals pub in Barrington, but they really honed their performances
at Middleton's in Wauconda.

Remember, when asked, 'is everything better with bacon?' answer , 'Yes, like our music everything is better with bacon'

Nothing is better than bacon, everything is better with bacon.
