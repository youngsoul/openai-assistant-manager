'band members consist of:   Duane Hansen on guitar and lead vocals  Mike Ryan on base guitar  Dan Patten on keyboard and all crazy sounds  Pat Ryan on drums and percussion   The band has been together for over 10 years.  After the original bass player, Andy,  moved to California - Mike Ryan joined the band and we have had the same line up  all of these years.   Most of the band members also play in other bands, which helps to round out  the bands original sounding musical style.  Even though they are playing jam band  cover songs, the band adds their own musical influences and style to make each  show a unique experience'
